/// The overview shape returned by the Gateway `projects.tree` RPC.
///
/// This is the companion tier to `projects.project_sessions`: the drill-in
/// hydrates one project's lanes with every chat row, while the overview
/// describes *all* projects with their structure and counts but with lane rows
/// emptied (`hydrate=False` in `tui_gateway/project_tree.py`). A Projects pane
/// therefore pays for one cheap call on entry and one hydrated call only when
/// the user actually enters a project.
///
/// Two things live here that `projects.list` cannot answer, because that call
/// returns projects-database records and knows nothing about chats:
///
/// - the repo/lane structure and chat counts behind each project card;
/// - [ProjectsTreeOverview.scopedSessionIds], the flat set of chats already
///   claimed by some project. Subtracting it from a flat session list is how
///   Hermes Desktop avoids listing the same chat twice, and Android must use
///   the same server-computed set rather than recomputing membership on device.
///
/// Parsing rules that matter, all pinned by `test/projects_tree_overview_test.dart`:
///
/// - counts come from the server and are never derived from the (empty) lanes,
///   or every card would read zero chats;
/// - one malformed project node is dropped rather than thrown, since taking
///   down the whole pane is a far worse failure than one missing card;
/// - server order is preserved verbatim across all three tiers (Home, explicit,
///   auto), so Android cannot rank projects differently from Desktop;
/// - an `active_id` naming no listed project is ignored, matching
///   `ProjectsSnapshot`.
