/// The Quick chat lifecycle store.
///
/// Phase 1 of `docs/ANDROID_DAILY_DRIVER_ROADMAP.md` validates Quick chat as a
/// creation mode that "auto-archives after 72 hours, never silently deletes"
/// and "can be promoted into a normal Project conversation at any time".
/// `buildNewChatDraft` already *computes* that deadline, but nothing kept it:
/// the draft was carried into a chat screen and forgotten, so no Quick chat
/// ever archived. This store is the missing persistence.
///
/// It is deliberately device-local and needs **no gateway contract**. The
/// gateway exposes no way to bind a session to a project or to mark one
/// ephemeral, so a legacy REST-only connection keeps working exactly as
/// before — an unrecorded chat is simply durable.
///
/// Four rules are encoded here rather than in a widget, so they can be
/// asserted without pumping a frame:
///
/// 1. **Archived is a state, never a deletion.** Passing the deadline changes
///    what [QuickChatState.statusFor] reports; the record survives, so the
///    chat stays searchable in Archived exactly as the roadmap requires.
/// 2. **The clock starts once.** Re-recording an existing Quick chat keeps its
///    original deadline, so reopening one cannot keep it alive forever.
/// 3. **Promotion is terminal.** Once the user keeps a chat, a replayed draft
///    can never put it back on an archive timer.
/// 4. **Never archive on a guess.** A record whose deadline cannot be read is
///    dropped rather than treated as expired.
